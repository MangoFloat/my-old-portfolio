			<h2><a href="comp.html">Computer Fundamentals</a></h2>
			<br>
			<p>
			The course introduces us the fundamental logic inside the computer.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
			In the first week, we were taught about logic gates, how the information they hold are binary, and how many can be combined to create more complex designs which can be used to aid humanity.
			</p>
			<p>
			Figure 1 shows a flip flop gate, this consists of two AND gates and two NOR gates. This is one of the simplest form of memory, the output (X & Y) are dependent on the previous inputs (1 & 2), and the 'En' input enables the circuit.
			</p>
			<p>
			We use <a href="http://www.cburch.com/logisim/download.html" title="Download Logisim here">Logisim</a> to recreate these circuits. We have made many more, and often trying to build one from using only the truth table, which is a diagram that shows the outputs of all possible combination of inputs.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
			During high school, I did GCSE Electronics, which made it easier for me to learn these, as I have already been introduced to them.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
			After learning the basics of the logic gates, we have been introduced to 'Mars MIPS' which allows us to program in MIPS assembly language. 
			Figure 1 and 2 are examples of how the software can be used to program a basic instruction. Figure 1 makes the console run a message ‘Hello World!’, and figure 2 multiplies 200 and 10 together.
			As you can see, this is unlike any other language, print and a message and multiplying a couple of numbers generally only need a couple lines of code to run, however, the MIPS assembly as a lot more complicated, though not necessarily difficult to learn.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
			We are also being taught discrete mathematics, such as sets, matrices, vectors and functions, and many more in the future. The mathematics we have covered is nothing I have not seen before, since I have done GCSE and A-level Mathematics, therefore there has been no difficulties learning these.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
			To finalise, I feel that what we are currently being taught is straightforward, however I believe it may become more difficult in the future. This will certainly help me develop the skills I already acquired during my Electornic GCSE.
