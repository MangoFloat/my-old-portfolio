			<br>
			<p>
			The unit introduces us to Information Systems in organisations. The labs help us learn key system analysis techniques, which will aid us for employment in businesses.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
			In the first week, we were introduced to organisations and their environment, in the context of implementing Information Systems. We were taught about different types of organisations, their aims, culture and sizes, this led into learning about the Needle’s ‘Business in Context’, showing varying aspects of the organisation, such as size, culture, goals (as mentioned before), structure and ownership.
			Lab sessions helped us learn about Strategy in business context, including the use of SWOT (strength, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats). We then had an exercise of implementing these techniques into real life scenarios.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
			We were then taught about the steps involving Systems Development Lifecycle, introducing us to the Waterfall model, their advantages and disadvantages.
			In the labs we learned about other alternative models to the development lifecycle, showcasing differences and similarities, while also considering their advantages and disadvantages with different types of organisation.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
			Next, we were then presented about Management Information and Decision Making in context with organisations. The lecture discussed how data can be processed into information, and how information can be qualitative and affect how decisions are made at different managerial levels. For example, information can be formal or informal, depending on how it is transferred, or how different types and sources of information can be more useful to certain levels of management (Figure 1)
			We were also taught about different types of reports and how they will be used, we had to learn these to help us write our assignment that was given out the week after.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
			For our assignment, we had to analyse and comment on a given scenario, we had to use what we learned previously to write a well detailed report, such as how using different types of reports will be implement to aid and improve the system.
			In the lecture, we learned how to design a Use Case Diagram(UCD). Figure 2 shows the UCD my group created for our second part of our assignment. The purpose of producing a UCD is to help us show who interacts with the system, and the goals they achieve with it.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
			After, we were then introduced to Entity Relationship Diagrams, which is a data modelling technique that allows us to see the relationship between different entities. Figure 3 is an example of an ERD for a library. This will also be used in our part two assignment.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
			The following week also taught another data modelling technique called Relational Data Analysis (RDA), which is also means Normalisation. This technique is used to maximise the efficiency of a group of data. Figure 4 is an example of a group of data being normalised, this is an exercise we did during the lab sessions. We were taught only 3 of the main normalisation process, however in the more advanced level, there can be up to 6 forms of normalised data (and maybe more).
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
			This is where I am up to within the course.
			<p>
			<br>
			<p>
			Overall, I believe this unit has been great, as not only this helped me understand the more business side of computers but also helped me develop my transferable teamwork abilities, such as communication, organisation and taking responsibility.
