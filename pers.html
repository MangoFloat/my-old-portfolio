			<br>
			<h4> Skills </h4>
			<p>
			I believe I can show great team working skills such as to communicate clearly within peers. I have played many sports, such as football and basketball, although I’ve not played competitively, I take every game seriously.
			</p>
			<p>
			Another piece of skill I take pride is that I am a good problem solver, especially in mathematics, I took GCSE and A-level Mathematics helped me further improve this ability.
			</p>
			<br>
			<h4>Room for improvement</h4>
			<p>
			I hope to develop my transferable skills, to aid me for employment, I will use the course and the many opportunities it offers to achieve this, especially the Information System unit, where it will allow me to further hone my team working abilities.
			During the course, the best skills I am learning is taking extra responsibility and organising my work, the course offers a lot of material to learn, which means I have to spend a lot of time outside the institute to keep up. Many coursework means I have to resolve many problems myself, although many support is offered, I’d like to figure things out myself.
			</p>
			<p>
			Another particular skill I would like to develop leadership, although communication is no problem, taking initiative when necessary can be problematic for me. This may be linked to my lack of confidence to take that extra step, if I improve my surroundings, while also trying to evolve myself
			my confidence level my grow naturally.
			<p>
			I would also like to join a society within the institute, to further enhance the opportunities I gain throughout my course.
