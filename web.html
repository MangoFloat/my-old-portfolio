			This course is probably the most enjoyable unit within the course.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>The first week briefly introduces us to the basics of HTML, such as tags for paragraphs, headings, images, hyperlinks, tables and lists.
			</p>
			<p>
			We were then introduced into CSS (cascading style sheet), which allows us to style and position different contents. We were taught that CSS should be external for good practice, as it offers better readability and reusability.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
			Figure 1 is an example of an unstylised list, figure 2 is an example of a CSS, figure 3 is the result of stylising the list from figure 1, using the CSS from figure 2. This is a small example of how we can use CSS, there are countless amounts of other ways different elements can be stylised.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
			For our assignment, we are using what we have learned so far to create an ePortfolio of ourselves, showcasing what we have covered so far, our past achievements and future goals. This has been the most fun assignments, as we are given freedom to design it on our own.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
			We have also been introduced to JavaScript and the use of canvas, using what we learn from it for another assignment. This assignment helps us understand how we can modify the HTML content, using listeners, events and handlers.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
			I believe this unit is very fun and intriguing, especially the ePortfolio assignment, as it gives us the flexibility of designing it our own.
